Context
The The datasets used in the new analyses are available to the public on the NHTSA website.

The documentation for the data sets can be downloaded from the same site. The best source of info for the CDS data is the NASS CDS Coding & Editing Manual and the NASS CDS Analytical Userâ€™s Manual. Both may be found here 
Code Books

The four SAS data sets used are as follows;

Content
"Occupant Assessment" - Providing information about the occupant and injuries

"General Vehicle" - Providing information about the impact speeds and the vehicle model

"Vehicle Exterior" - Provides the direction of impact

"Accident Description" - Provides the "git ratio inflation factor" used for weighting the data.

These data sets are provided for each year. Individual cases are distinguished by year of accident, primary sampling unit, and case ID. The case IDs refer to the accident; within accident individual cars are identified by a "vehicle number" and within vehicles, each occupant is identified by an "occupant number". Using these identifiers, the user may combine the data sets.

Occupant Assessment
As a reminder: Occupant Assessment provides information about the occupant and injuries squired. Variables used from the "Occupant Assessment" data sets include;

"AGE" - 'AGE OF OCCUPANT'

"BAGAVAIL" - 'AIR BAG SYSTEM AVAILABILITY'

"BAGDEPLY" - 'AIR BAG SYSTEM DEPLOYED'

"BAGFAIL" - 'AIR BAG SYSTEM FAILURE'

"CASEID" - 'CASE NUMBER - STRATUM'

"CASENO" - 'CASE SEQUENCE NUMBER'

"CHTYPE" - 'TYPE OF CHILD SAFETY SEAT'

"DEATH" - 'TIME TO DEATH'

"HEIGHT" - 'HEIGHT OF OCCUPANT'

"HOSPSTAY" - 'HOSPITAL STAY'

"INJSEV" - 'INJURY SEVERITY (POLICE RATING)'

"MANUSE" - 'MANUAL BELT SYSTEM USE'

"OCCNO" - 'OCCUPANT NUMBER'

"PSU" - 'PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT NUMBER'

"ROLE" - 'OCCUPANT'S ROLE'

"SEATPOS" - 'OCCUPANT'S SEAT POSITION'

"SEX" - 'OCCUPANT'S SEX'

"TREATMNT" - 'TREATMENT - MORTALITY'

"VEHNO" - 'VEHICLE NUMBER'

"WEIGHT" - 'OCCUPANT'S WEIGHT'

General Vehicle
As a reminder: the "general vehicle" file, provided information about the impact speeds and the vehicle model. The variables used to create data set for General Vehicle data include;

"PSU" - 'PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT NUMBER'

"CASEID" - 'CASE NUMBER - STRATUM'

"VEHNO" - 'VEHICLE NUMBER'

"BODYTYPE" - 'VEHICLE BODY TYPE'

"MODELYR" - 'VEHICLE MODEL YEAR'

"DVTOTAL" - 'TOTAL DELTA V'

"DVBASIS" - 'BASIS FOR TOTAL DELTA V (HIGHEST)'

"DVEST" - 'ESTIMATED HIGHEST DELTA V'

"MAKE" - 'VEHICLE MAKE'

"Vehicle Exterior"
As a reminder: the "Vehicle Exterior" data provides the direction of impact.

The variables used to create this data table include;

"PSU" - 'PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT NUMBER'

"DOF1" - 'DIRECTION OF FORCE (HIGHEST)'

"CASEID" -'CASE NUMBER - STRATUM'

"GAD1" - 'DEFORMATION LOCATION (HIGHEST)'

"Accident Description"
As a reminder: The "Accident Description" data table provides the "ratio inflation factor" used for weighting the data.

The variables used to create the data table were;

"PSU" - 'PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT NUMBER'

"STRATIF" - 'CASE STRATUM'

"CASEID" - 'CASE NUMBER - STRATUM'

PSU NUMBER (PSU), CASE NUMBER-STRATUM (CASEID) and CASE SEQUENCE NUMBER (CASENO) are identical variables across all NASS records. CASENO is the first three digits of CASEID.

Thanks to Nass for making their datasets free to the public by year.

Inspiration
I was inspired to create this dataset to analyse safety. My question to you is can you find any information that might be valid to the general public based on this dataset that I created by combining the years from 2004 - 2014.
